This repo will help me te learn more about Git and Github.
But this is also used to help to learn the C programming language.
Every time I create a new file I will commit and push this to Github so I can edit them later if I want to.
And I want to get it open source, so that other people can take a look at the code if they want.

I'm just a starter with the C language so don't expect great programs from me!
But I really want to learn this language and you'll need to start somewhere.
